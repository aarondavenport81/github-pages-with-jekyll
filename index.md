# Welcome to my blog

### About Me:
My name is Aaron Davenport, and I have a thirst for knowledge. The current way I'm quenching that thirst is by trying to get a fairly broad knowledge of coding. I probably won't go super in depth in any specific language or anything, but learning a bit on here about how to build a website, playing around with the API on YNAB to learn that side of coding, maybe even adding some functional Java or Python scripts to my *portfolio.*
